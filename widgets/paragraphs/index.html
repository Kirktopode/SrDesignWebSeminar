	  <p>Paragraph elements are meant to contain text for the body of an article, a description for a video, or any other place that a paragraph would fit into. Each element can be given a "class" or "id" attribute, as seen in the elements below. Only one element should have a given id, while a class can be used for multiple elements. These classes and ids represent potential targets for CSS styles, as seen in the styles.css file in this directory. CSS can also style specific elements or designate styles to be used by triggered events, such as during a mouseover or a click.</p>
	  <p id="example-id">This paragraph will turn bold on mouseover, and will reverse colors on a click. These styles can be seen in the "#example-id" section. The "#id-name" format is used to target the style for any id in the index file.</p>
	  <p class="blue">This paragraph is in the "blue" class. You can add or remove styles in styles.css under the ".blue" section. This class happens to be aligned to the right, which can also be changed in the stylesheet.</p>
	  <p class="blue">This paragraph is also in the "blue" class.</p>
	  <p class="red">This paragraph is in the "red" class. The stylesheet centers this class.</p>
