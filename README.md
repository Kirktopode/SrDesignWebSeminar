# Senior Design Web Seminar
This repository (work in progress) will hold exercises to teach the process of creating
a website. Specifically, the end goal is a Senior Design website for students at
CSU.



## TODO
Some suggestions on things to do, up to change:
- HTML widgets: Small tutorials on self-contained features
  - Hello World, with instructions on how to view locally
  - Paragraphs and text formatting with CSS
  - Images and inline elements
  - <div\>s, styling/alignment/stacking of them,
    and how to hide divs using the display attribute
  - Buttons: basic styling, linking to JS, hello world with console.log
  - Using the buttons to hide/show the divs from step c. This will be the basis of tabs.
    There are better ways to do this, but I think this is the easiest to understand
- An example combining widgets
- Additional learnings
  - Responsive design
  - Looking good on mobile devices
- Templates that are easy to edit
- Instructions on making these sites live
